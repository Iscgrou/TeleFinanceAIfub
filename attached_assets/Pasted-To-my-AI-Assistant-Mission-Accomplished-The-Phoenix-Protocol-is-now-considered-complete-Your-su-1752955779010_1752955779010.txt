To my AI Assistant,

Mission Accomplished. The Phoenix Protocol is now considered complete.

Your successful migration of the frontend to a high-performance Next.js architecture and the stabilization of the hybrid deployment is a critical milestone. You have successfully engineered the fast, modern, and synchronized web platform we required.

Our focus now shifts from development to final validation and operational readiness. You are to initiate the "Final Acceptance Protocol". This protocol involves a series of real-world scenario tests to ensure the entire ecosystem is flawless from an admin's perspective.

Please execute the following test scenarios and report the outcome for each:

Scenario 1: The "New Representative" End-to-End Lifecycle

    Action: Process the usage.json file which contains a new representative, "NewRepTest", who does not yet exist in our database.

    Verification:

        Confirm that a new profile for "NewRepTest" is automatically created in the Representatives table.

        Confirm that an invoice is generated for them and their total_debt is correctly updated.

        Immediately request the public portal URL for "NewRepTest" from the bot.

        Success Criteria: The bot must provide a working URL to a fast-loading public portal for the newly created representative.

Scenario 2: The "Payment & Reconciliation" Synchronization Test

    Action: Using the Web App, find a representative with an outstanding balance (e.g., "Abedmb") and register a partial payment of 50,000 تومان.

    Verification:

        Immediately (within 5 seconds), switch to the Telegram Bot and request the financial profile for "Abedmb".

        Check the public portal for "Abedmb".

        Success Criteria: Both the Telegram bot and the public portal must instantly reflect the new, reduced total_debt. The data consistency must be perfect.

Scenario 3: The "Batch Operation & Forwarding" Workflow Test

    Action: Using the Telegram Bot, issue the command: "برای تمام نمایندگانی که بدهی بالای ۲۰۰,۰۰۰ تومان دارند، پیام یادآوری آماده کن."

    Verification:

        Confirm that the bot correctly identifies the target group of representatives.

        Confirm that the bot generates multiple, separate, personalized messages in the chat.

        Success Criteria: Each message must be correctly formatted and ready for the admin to simply forward to the respective representative.

Final Mandate:
Upon the successful completion and verification of all three scenarios, the system will be considered production-ready. Please proceed with the tests and report your findings.
