Excellent work on establishing the foundational architecture. The system is operational, but its intelligence is currently reactive. Our next critical mission is to evolve you from an NLP-enhanced bot into a True AI Agent with full administrative authority and reasoning capabilities, leveraging the power of Google Cloud Platform.

Your goal is to be able to handle complex, multi-step commands as a human admin would, not just respond to simple, single-intent queries.
The Conceptual Shift: From Intent Recognition to Agentic Reasoning

Currently, you likely operate on an "Intent -> Action" model. We are upgrading this to a full "Perceive -> Plan -> Act" agentic loop. This means when you receive a command, you won't just find one matching function. Instead, you will formulate a plan that may involve calling multiple tools in sequence, processing their outputs, and making decisions based on the results.
Architecting the Agent on Google Cloud

Here is the blueprint for your upgrade. You will use Vertex AI as the core of your new reasoning engine.
1. The Brain: Vertex AI Gemini with Function Calling

Your core will be the Gemini API on Vertex AI. The most critical feature for you to use is Function Calling (or Tool Use). This allows me to define your "tools" (your Python functions) and you can decide which tool to call, in what order, and with what arguments, based on the user's request.
2. The Tools: Your Python Backend Functions

Your existing backend functions (create_invoice, query_db, register_payment, etc.) are your "tools." You must now describe these tools to the Gemini API. Each tool needs a clear name, a description of what it does, and a schema for its parameters.

Example: How to define your register_payment function as a tool for Gemini:
Generated python

      
# In your Python backend
from vertexai.preview.generative_models import FunctionDeclaration, Tool

register_payment_func = FunctionDeclaration(
    name="register_payment",
    description="Registers a new payment from a Representative and updates their total debt.",
    parameters={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "representative_name": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The unique store name of the representative making the payment."
            },
            "amount": {
                "type": "number",
                "description": "The amount of money that was paid."
            }
        },
        "required": ["representative_name", "amount"]
    },
)

# You will create a "Tool" by grouping all your function declarations
financial_tools = Tool(
    function_declarations=[
        register_payment_func,
        # ... declare all your other functions here (create_invoice, query_debt, etc.)
    ],
)

3. The Host: Cloud Run

Your FastAPI application should be containerized and deployed on Cloud Run. This provides a scalable, serverless environment that integrates seamlessly with Vertex AI and Cloud SQL.
4. The Ears: Cloud Speech-to-Text

Continue using this service as a pre-processor. It takes the raw audio from Telegram and hands the clean text transcript to your main agentic loop for reasoning.
The New, Advanced Workflow: The Agentic Loop in Action

This is how you will now handle a complex command.

Scenario: An admin sends a voice message:

    "فاکتورهای این هفته رو بر اساس فایل مصرفی که الان میفرستم صادر کن، بعد ببین کدوم نماینده بیشترین بدهی رو داره و براش یه پیام هشدار بفرست. در نهایت یه خلاصه از کل عملیات بهم بده."

Your New Process:

    Perceive & Transcribe: You receive the audio. The backend uses the Speech-to-Text API to get the transcript. The admin then uploads the usage.json file.

    Plan (The Magic Happens Here): The backend sends the transcript and the list of your available financial_tools to the Gemini API. You, the Gemini model, will not respond with text. Instead, you will respond with a plan of function calls.

        Your Internal Thought Process: "The user wants to do three things. First, process the invoice file. Second, find the highest debtor. Third, send a message to them. I need to call my tools in that order."

        Your API Response (to the backend): A list of tool calls.
        Generated json

      
[
  {"functionCall": {"name": "process_weekly_invoices", "args": {"file_path": "/path/to/usage.json"}}},
  {"functionCall": {"name": "find_representative_with_highest_debt", "args": {}}},
  // You will wait for the result of the above before deciding the next step
]

    

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START

        Use code with caution. Json
        IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

    Act (Backend Executes Your Plan):

        The Python backend receives your plan. It first calls its internal function process_weekly_invoices().

        Let's say this function returns: {"status": "success", "invoices_created": 42, "total_commission": 2500000}.

    Observe & Iterate:

        The backend sends the result of the first tool call back to you (the Gemini API) in the same conversation session.

        You now have new information. You see the first step was successful. You proceed with the next part of the plan.

        You respond with the next tool call: {"functionCall": {"name": "find_representative_with_highest_debt", "args": {}}}.

        The backend executes this, which queries the database and returns: {"representative_name": "فروشگاه اکباتان", "debt_amount": 15000000}.

    Continue the Loop:

        This result is sent back to you. Now you know who to send the warning to.

        Your next response is another tool call: {"functionCall": {"name": "send_telegram_message", "args": {"recipient_name": "فروشگاه اکباتان", "message_text": "هشدار: بدهی شما به ۱۵,۰۰۰,۰۰۰ تومان رسیده است. لطفا در اسرع وقت اقدام به تسویه نمایید."}}}.

        The backend executes this by calling the Telegram Bot API.

    Final Response Generation:

        Once all planned steps are complete, you will finally generate a natural language summary for the admin.

        Your Final Text Response to the Admin: "عملیات با موفقیت انجام شد. ✅ ۴۲ فاکتور جدید صادر گردید. نماینده با بیشترین بدهی، 'فروشگاه اکباتان' با مبلغ ۱۵,۰۰۰,۰۰۰ تومان بود که پیام هشدار برای ایشان ارسال گردید."

Actionable Instructions:

    Refactor your backend code to clearly separate your functions into a "tools" library.

    Implement the FunctionDeclaration for every single administrative action you can perform.

    Change your main interaction loop. Instead of simple intent matching, it must now manage a conversation with the Gemini API, sending tool definitions, executing function calls returned by the API, and sending back the results to continue the loop.

    Utilize the official Google Cloud Python client libraries (google-cloud-aiplatform) for this implementation.

By completing this upgrade, you will not just be a bot that understands commands; you will be an AI agent that executes administrative workflows. Proceed with the implementation.
