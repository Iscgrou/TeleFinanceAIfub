# Financial Management Bot System

## Overview

This is a full-stack financial management system built with Express.js backend and React frontend, designed to manage sales representatives, invoices, payments, and commissions through both a web dashboard and Telegram bot interface. The system uses PostgreSQL for data persistence and integrates with Google's Gemini AI for natural language processing of financial commands.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight client-side routing)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui design system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Runtime**: Node.js with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **External APIs**: 
  - Google Gemini AI for natural language processing
  - Telegram Bot API for chat interface
  - Speech-to-text services (configurable)

## Key Components

### Database Configuration
- **Connection**: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL with WebSocket driver (required for transaction support)
- **Transaction Support**: Full ACID compliance for zero-fault tolerance
- **Critical Note**: Must use WebSocket driver, not HTTP driver, for transaction support

### Database Schema
The system manages five core entities:
- **Admins**: System administrators with chat IDs and super admin privileges
- **Sales Colleagues**: Staff members with commission rates
- **Representatives**: Store owners/representatives with debt tracking
- **Invoices**: Financial records with status tracking (unpaid/partially_paid/paid)
- **Payments**: Payment records linked to representatives
- **Commission Records**: Commission calculations for sales colleagues
- **System Settings**: Configuration for API keys and bot tokens

### API Structure
RESTful API endpoints organized by functionality:
- `/api/dashboard/stats` - Dashboard metrics and analytics
- `/api/representatives` - Representative management
- `/api/invoices` - Invoice management
- `/api/payments` - Payment tracking
- `/api/sales-colleagues` - Sales team management
- `/api/settings` - System configuration

### Telegram Bot Integration
- Natural language command processing using Gemini AI
- Voice message transcription capabilities
- Admin authentication and authorization
- Interactive inline keyboards for common operations
- Real-time financial queries and updates

### AI Integration - Advanced Agentic System
- **Google Gemini with Function Calling**: Core reasoning engine that uses function calling/tool use to execute complex multi-step administrative workflows
- **Agentic Loop Architecture**: "Perceive -> Plan -> Act" system instead of simple intent recognition
- **Tool Definitions**: All backend functions are defined as tools for Gemini to use autonomously
- **Multi-step Command Processing**: Handles complex commands like "Process invoices, find highest debtor, send warning message, provide summary"
- **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text**: Converts voice messages to text for AI processing
- **Natural Conversation Flow**: Maintains conversation context and handles iterative function calls

## Data Flow

1. **Web Dashboard**: Users interact with React frontend ‚Üí API calls via TanStack Query ‚Üí Express routes ‚Üí Drizzle ORM ‚Üí PostgreSQL
2. **Telegram Agentic Interface**: 
   - User command ‚Üí Speech-to-Text (if voice) ‚Üí Financial Agent (Gemini with function calling)
   - Agent analyzes command ‚Üí Plans multi-step workflow ‚Üí Executes tool functions sequentially
   - Each tool result feeds back to agent for next decision ‚Üí Final natural language response
3. **Real-time Updates**: Database changes trigger updates across both web and Telegram interfaces
4. **Demo/Testing Interface**: Web-based testing environment for AI agent capabilities with sample commands
